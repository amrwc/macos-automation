# Brightness

A utility for changing the screen brightness from command-line.

## Setup

1. Install `brightness` via Homebrew or from source â€“ according to some comments in the GitHub issues, building from
   source may fix some issues with external monitors.

   ```console
   brew install brightness
   ```

   ```console
   git clone https://github.com/nriley/brightness.git
   cd brightness
   make
   sudo make install
   ```

1. Create a symlink to the script. Note that since this script depends on `brightness` from Homebrew, the symlink
   cannot have the same name.

   ```console
   ln -s "$(pwd)/brightness.py" /usr/local/bin/bright
   ```

## Usage

Use a decimal between 0 and 1 to represent the brightness percentage.

```console
./brightness.py <decimal>
bright <decimal>
```
